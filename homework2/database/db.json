      "description": "Autism is a complex developmental disability. Generally, Autism presents itself during the first three years of a person's life. The condition has an effect on normal brain function characterized by social impairments, communication difficulties, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behaviour. Males are five times more likely to be affected than females. As early as infancy, a baby with Autism may be unresponsive to people or focus intently on one item only. A child may appear to develop normally and then withdraw and become indifferent to social engagement. Children may fail to respond to their names and often avoid eye contact with other people. They have difficulty interpreting what others are thinking or feeling because they can't understand social cues.\"e;Autism - A Handbook of Diagnosis & Treatment of ASD\"e; discusses signs, symptoms, causes, myths, facts, therapies, treatment, education, career and many more things related to autism. It provides practical advice so that the special child can lead a quality life to the extent possible."
