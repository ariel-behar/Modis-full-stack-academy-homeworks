      "description": "A fast-paced guide to designing and building scalable and maintainable web apps with React.jsAbout This Book• Build maintainable and performant user interfaces for your web applications using React.js• Create reusable React.js components to save time and effort in maintaining your user interfaces• Learn how to build a ready-to-deploy React.js web application, following our step-by-step tutorialWho This Book Is ForIf you're a front-end developer with knowledge of jQuery and its libraries, along with frameworks, such as Angular.JS and Backbone.JS, or native JavaScript development, and you wish to use the fastest web user interface library there is, then this book is ideal for you.What You Will Learn• Install powerful React.js tools to make development much more efficient• Create React elements with properties and children• Get started with stateless and stateful React components• Use JSX to speed up your React.js development process• Add reactivity to your React components with lifecycle methods• Integrate your React components with other JavaScript libraries• Utilize the Flux application architecture with your React components• Test your React components with Jest test frameworkIn DetailBuilding web applications with maintainable and performant user interfaces is a challenge that many have faced for more than a decade, but no one has risen to this challenge quite like React.js. Today React.js is used by Facebook, Instagram, Khan Academy, and Imperial College London, to name a few. Many new users recognize the benefits of React.js and adopt it in their own projects, forming a fast-growing community. The speed at which React.js has evolved promises a bright future for those who invest in learning it today.React.js Essentials will take you on a fast-paced journey through building your own maintainable React.js application. Begin by exploring how you can create single and multiple user interface elements. Create stateless and stateful components and make them reactive, learn to interact between your components and lifecycle methods and gauge how to effectively integrate your user interface components with other JavaScript libraries. Delve deep into the core elements of the Flux architecture and learn how to manage your application using stores. Finish by going that extra mile with the Jest test framework, running multiple tests on your application and find solutions to scale it further without complexity.Style and approachThe book adopts a step-by-step, hands-on approach with ample codes to ensure you learn React.js at a fast pace.",

      "description": "This straight-talking and accessible guide for parents of teenagers on the autism spectrum provides down-to-earth advice on coping with the more difficult issues that can arise at home and school during the adolescent years. Andrew Schlegelmilch discusses common parenting challenges and offers advice drawn from his extensive experience working with teenagers with autism and their families as Head Psychologist at a college preparatory school. He offers parents professional guidance on what to do about falling grades, how to handle adolescent tantrums, how to talk about sex and sexuality with your child, how to help your child with peer relationships, how to keep your child safe online, and what to do if you suspect your child has mental health problems. Integral to the discussion is how to set realistic expectations and encourage independence in ways that work for both your child with autism and the rest of the family, as well as how to make the best use of the help professionals can offer.",

      "description": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is currently diagnosed based on a series of behavioral tests. The challenge for researchers is to try to uncover the biological basis for these typical behaviors in order to improve diagnosis and identify potential targets for treatment. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary in order to move forward. This includes analysis of the current animal models for ASD and their suitability, reviewing immunological, immunogenetic and epigenetic research, reassessing clinical diagnostic tools, and surveying radiological, pathological, and serological records for clues. This volume includes research from some of the leading researchers on ASD. We are hopeful that it will stimulate further dialogue and research in this challenging field.",

The author offers guidance on how to evaluate services and programmes and how to recognise which will be most effective in different scenarios for people with differing needs. A wide range of measures are reviewed in detail, including assessments used in situations often ignored in overviews relevant to ASD, such as assessments of internet addiction, response to traumatic stress, and criminal offending risk and witness credibility. This book is an invaluable resource to professionals who support people with ASDs, including social workers and teachers, and who are under increasing pressure to reliably assess which services, programmes and therapies are effective and fit-for-purpose.",

      "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a relatively new diagnostic label which reflects the variability and differentiation of symptomatology among children and youth commonly described as having autistic disorder, high-functioning autism (HFA), and Asperger's syndrome. Current best practices have emerged from decades of evidence-based research, research-to-practice translation of empirically supported procedures, and consensus-driven recommendations from multiple disciplines. As a result, practitioners have many educational and intervention choices for children and youth with ASD--what is critical is that these options are informed by empirical outcomes that have been replicated in experimental trials (group and single-case) and disseminated to professionals and researchers alike. Children and Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a state-of-the-art volume of 15 chapters across four thematic sections that reflect the current convention of viewing autism along a continuum of presenting symptoms. Skillfully edited by James K. Luiselli, sections cover diagnosis, assessment, and measurement; evidence-based practices; health and development; and additional topics such as mindful caregiving and support, CBT, and behavioral family intervention. Compiling the most up-to-date advances in approaches toward diagnosis, education, treatment, and program development, Children and Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) will be a valuable resource for professionals and trainees in the ASD field including psychologists, educators, therapists, behavior analysts, and similar practitioners. It is also appropriate for academic researchers and courses devoted to clinical psychology, special education, developmental disabilities, and special topics.",

      "description": "This cutting-edge resource provides a comprehensive review of available assessment tools for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), presenting up-to-date evidence for their efficacy as well as best practice for selecting appropriate forms of assessment across the lifespan. Gathering together the latest international research evidence, Kenneth J. Aitken provides a clear evaluation of the commonly used assessment measures, and examines other tools not yet validated for ASD assessment but which are likely to have promising applications for the field. The tools covered include those relating to core assessment areas, such as cognitive ability, communication, motor skills and executive function, as well as supplementary and emerging areas of assessment, such as behaviour and attention, sensory issues, anxiety and depression, friendships and loneliness, and internet safety. This pioneering report will be an indispensable primary reference for researchers, academics, clinicians, service providers and commissioners.",
