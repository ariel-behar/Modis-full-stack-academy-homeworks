                <p class="book-description">Autism is a complex developmental disability. Generally, Autism presents
                    itself during the first three years of a person's life. The condition has an effect on normal brain
                    function characterized by social impairments, communication difficulties, and restricted,
                    repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behaviour. Males are five times more likely to be affected
                    than females. As early as infancy, a baby with Autism may be unresponsive to people or focus
                    intently on one item only. A child may appear to develop normally and then withdraw and become
                    indifferent to social engagement. Children may fail to respond to their names and often avoid eye
                    contact with other people. They have difficulty interpreting what others are thinking or feeling
                    because they can't understand social cues."e;Autism - A Handbook of Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of
                    ASD"e; discusses signs, symptoms, causes, myths, facts, therapies, treatment, education, career and
                    many more things related to autism. It provides practical advice so that the special child can lead

                <p class="book-description">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD hereafter) is a neurodevelopmental condition
                    characterized by deficits in communicative and social skills. The vast majority of research on
                    language in ASD has focused on pragmatic difficulties, while less is known about structural aspects
                    of language in this population. Work on syntax and phonology is not only sparse, but the
                    heterogeneity in these grammatical domains has moreover led to conflicting reports that they are
                    either intact or impaired. More remains to be understood about variations in grammatical profiles in
                    ASD, as well as the relation of grammar to other cognitive abilities. The body of research gathered
                    here increases our understanding of the grammatical strengths and weaknesses in ASD. The
                    contributions carefully elucidate the relations between grammar and other areas of cognition, as
                    well as unveil the similarities and differences of grammar in ASD compared to other conditions. The
                    result is a volume that provides new ways to think about language and communication in ASD, and
                    beyond, which should be of interest to both linguists and clinicians.</p>

                <p class="book-description">This Research Topic covers the pathogenetic processes in Autism Spectrum
                    Disorder (ASD) that underpin the translation of genetic vulnerability to clinically significant
                    symptoms. Available research data in ASD suggests that it is a neural connectivity disorder and that
                    the social communication and related neurobehavioural symptoms result from reduced synchronization
                    between key "social brain" regions. These interconnected neural systems can be understood through
                    the relationship between functionally relevant anatomic areas and neurochemical pathways, the
                    programming of which are genetically modulated during neurodevelopment and mediated through a range
                    of epigenetic and environmental modulators. Elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms can
                    provide an invaluable window for understanding the neural wiring that regulates higher brain
                    functions and consequent clinical phenotypes. In keeping with the multi modal and diverse origins of
                    ASD, this Research Topic explores the genetic underpinnings and environmental modulation in the
                    aetiology; neural substrates, biomarkers and endophenotypes that underlie clinical characteristics;
                    as well as neurochemical pathways and pathophysiological mechanisms that pave the way for
                    therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, since genetically mediated deficits and consequent
                    functional impairments involve activity-dependent synapse development that depends on postnatal
                    learning and experience, the trajectory towards the final clinical expression could be modulated by
                    early interventions that exploit the neuronal maturation and brain plasticity. However, identifying
                    these diverse pathogenetic processes and tailoring interventions would require subtyping ASD into
                    homogeneous subgroups. In this regard, this topic covers the current state of evidence in the
                    literature through topic reviews as well as ongoing original work that provides tangible hypotheses
                    and directions for future research.</p>

                    clinicians seeking an update. Different people with autism can have very different symptoms. Autism
                    is considered to be a "spectrum" disorder, a group of disorders with similar features. Some people
                    may experience merely mild disturbances, while the others have very serious symptoms. This book is
                    aimed to be used as a textbook for child and adolescent psychiatry fellowship training and will
                    serve as a reference for practicing psychologists, child and adolescent psychiatrists, general
                    psychiatrists, pediatricians, child neurologists, nurses, social workers and family physicians. A

                <p class="book-description">In DSM-5, published in 2013, the classification of autism spectrum disorder
                    (ASD) was created, subsuming several diagnoses and representing a significant evolution from its
                    first appearance in the DSM-III three decades earlier. Autism Spectrum Disorders reflects this
                    evolution, offering clinicians and families a succinct, definitive, and up-to-date guide to current
                    research in the field and its impact on assessment and treatment. The book begins with the
                    epidemiology of ASDs, which have increased in prevalence, and explores genetic heritability and
                    environmental risk factors. It then explains the roles of the psychiatrist, neurologist and
                    pediatrician in assessing the patient, examines assessment tools and processes, and describes the
                    latest advances in a variety of treatments and interventions. The text's focus is on educating and
                    empowering families and health care providers to determine whether appropriate genetic testing and
                    counseling have been undertaken, whether the individual has had the relevant assessment, and whether
                    skilled behavioral treatment and additional medical assessment or treatment are required.
                    Specifically, the text: Reviews existing prevalence estimates for ASDs since 2000 and discusses
                    methodological factors impacting the estimation of prevalence and the interpretation of changes in
                    prevalence estimates over time. Evaluates genomic and epigenomic research over the last decade in
                    the context of translating findings to practice, in terms of testing (e.g., copy number variants and
                    whole-exome sequencing) and counseling. Examines the role of environmental toxicity in immune
                    dysregulation, which has now been noted among individuals with ASD and their family members by
                    numerous studies. Reviews medical and cognitive assessments that may be needed. Reviews targeted
                    treatments that have the potential to reverse neurobiological abnormalities in ASD Reviews
                    behavioral treatments that are effective in promoting development and improving behavior. Describes
                    the Developmental, Individual Difference, Relationship-based (DIR) model, a comprehensive
                    developmental theory with relevance across the lifespan, which targets the core deficits of ASD
                    identified in DSM-5. Provides an overview of school-based interventions for students with autism,
                    exploring the rationale for conducting school-based research and examining existing teacher-,
                    paraprofessional-, and peer-mediated interventions school-based interventions. Explores other
                    approaches to ASDs, such as complementary and integrative approaches and non-invasive brain
                    stimulation technologies, including transcranial magnetic stimulation. The push for early screening
                    is resulting in earlier diagnosis of ASDs and the provision of evidence-based interventions that
                    have a positive impact on outcomes. Autism Spectrum Disorders provides a bench-to-bedside guide that
                    is essential reading for health care providers and families facing the challenges inherent in these
                    complex disorders.</p>
