                <p class="book-description">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is currently diagnosed based on a series of
                    behavioral tests. The challenge for researchers is to try to uncover the biological basis for these
                    typical behaviors in order to improve diagnosis and identify potential targets for treatment. A
                    multidisciplinary approach is necessary in order to move forward. This includes analysis of the
                    current animal models for ASD and their suitability, reviewing immunological, immunogenetic and
                    epigenetic research, reassessing clinical diagnostic tools, and surveying radiological,
                    pathological, and serological records for clues. This volume includes research from some of the
                    leading researchers on ASD. We are hopeful that it will stimulate further dialogue and research in
                    this challenging field.</p>

                <p class="book-description">Advocating for an increased emphasis on evidence-based practice, this book
                    describes and analyses a wide range of available Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) assessment measures.
                    The author offers guidance on how to evaluate services and programmes and how to recognise which
                    will be most effective in different scenarios for people with differing needs. A wide range of
                    measures are reviewed in detail, including assessments used in situations often ignored in overviews
                    relevant to ASD, such as assessments of internet addiction, response to traumatic stress, and
                    criminal offending risk and witness credibility. This book is an invaluable resource to
                    professionals who support people with ASDs, including social workers and teachers, and who are under
                    increasing pressure to reliably assess which services, programmes and therapies are effective and
                    fit-for-purpose.</p>

                <p class="book-description">This six-page laminated reference guide by Padmaja Sarathy presents seven
                    steps for maximizing academic, social, and life outcomes for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders
                    (ASD), while minimizing the impact of some of their complex behavioral and learning characteristics.
                    Packed with practical and proven strategies, this guide is an invaluable resource for all those who
                    work with children with ASD, including classroom teachers, paraeducators, support staff, and
                    parents. The environmental and instructional supports outlined in this guide are derived from sound
                    research-based practices. When these supportive interventions are applied cohesively and implemented
                    consistently, they provide effective personalized interventions for responding to the unique needs
                    of children with ASD. They include Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorders Structural Supports
                    Visual Supports Academic Supports Social Skills Supports Self-Regulation Supports Crisis Supports
                    The guide details each of the seven steps and provides examples of interventions and techniques that
                    teachers can put into practice immediately to improve outcomes for students with Autism Spectrum
                    Disorders.</p>

                <p class="book-description">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a relatively new diagnostic label which
                    reflects the variability and differentiation of symptomatology among children and youth commonly
                    described as having autistic disorder, high-functioning autism (HFA), and Asperger's syndrome.
                    Current best practices have emerged from decades of evidence-based research, research-to-practice
                    translation of empirically supported procedures, and consensus-driven recommendations from multiple
                    disciplines. As a result, practitioners have many educational and intervention choices for children
                    and youth with ASD--what is critical is that these options are informed by empirical outcomes that
                    have been replicated in experimental trials (group and single-case) and disseminated to
                    professionals and researchers alike. Children and Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a
                    state-of-the-art volume of 15 chapters across four thematic sections that reflect the current
                    convention of viewing autism along a continuum of presenting symptoms. Skillfully edited by James K.
                    Luiselli, sections cover diagnosis, assessment, and measurement; evidence-based practices; health
                    and development; and additional topics such as mindful caregiving and support, CBT, and behavioral
                    family intervention. Compiling the most up-to-date advances in approaches toward diagnosis,
                    education, treatment, and program development, Children and Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder
                    (ASD) will be a valuable resource for professionals and trainees in the ASD field including
                    psychologists, educators, therapists, behavior analysts, and similar practitioners. It is also
                    appropriate for academic researchers and courses devoted to clinical psychology, special education,
                    developmental disabilities, and special topics.</p>

                <p class="book-description">Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a complex set of neurodevelopmental
                    disorders with which one in sixty-eight children in the United States have been diagnosed. However,
                    their causes are still unclear and there are no known cures. Effective, evidence-based treatments
                    are emerging, but they are primarily school and behavior-based. There is an ongoing need to
                    understand and implement techniques and interventions that can address and change social
                    communication and interaction deficiencies for people diagnosed with ASD. A Guide to Counseling
                    Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders is the third of three books on therapeutic issues
                    specific to individuals with ASD. The first two books outline a theoretical approach and a practical
                    intervention program named Social Competence Enhancement Program (SCEP). They primarily address
                    group interventions and techniques. A Guide to Counseling Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders
                    applies the SCEP approach to individual therapeutic work. By considering the useful and
                    evidence-supported elements of interventions for individuals with ASD and applying them within the
                    individual psychotherapy process, this book suggests ways to help people with ASD achieve a higher
                    quality of life, by addressing and reducing the experience of internal distress; by understanding
                    its sources; and by teaching clients to take control and make appropriate and adaptive changes.
                    Vignettes from actual clinical situations are used to demonstrate particular issues that arise and
                    to illustrate how to employ interventions found useful with individuals with ASD....</p>

                <p class="book-description">This straight-talking and accessible guide for parents of teenagers on the
                    autism spectrum provides down-to-earth advice on coping with the more difficult issues that can
                    arise at home and school during the adolescent years. Andrew Schlegelmilch discusses common
                    parenting challenges and offers advice drawn from his extensive experience working with teenagers
                    with autism and their families as Head Psychologist at a college preparatory school. He offers
                    parents professional guidance on what to do about falling grades, how to handle adolescent tantrums,
                    how to talk about sex and sexuality with your child, how to help your child with peer relationships,
                    how to keep your child safe online, and what to do if you suspect your child has mental health
                    problems. Integral to the discussion is how to set realistic expectations and encourage independence
                    in ways that work for both your child with autism and the rest of the family, as well as how to make
                    the best use of the help professionals can offer.</p>

                <p class="book-description">This cutting-edge resource provides a comprehensive review of available
                    assessment tools for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), presenting up-to-date evidence for their
                    efficacy as well as best practice for selecting appropriate forms of assessment across the lifespan.
                    Gathering together the latest international research evidence, Kenneth J. Aitken provides a clear
                    evaluation of the commonly used assessment measures, and examines other tools not yet validated for
                    ASD assessment but which are likely to have promising applications for the field. The tools covered
                    include those relating to core assessment areas, such as cognitive ability, communication, motor
                    skills and executive function, as well as supplementary and emerging areas of assessment, such as
                    behaviour and attention, sensory issues, anxiety and depression, friendships and loneliness, and
                    internet safety. This pioneering report will be an indispensable primary reference for researchers,
                    academics, clinicians, service providers and commissioners.</p>
