      "description": "This straight-talking and accessible guide for parents of teenagers on the autism spectrum provides down-to-earth advice on coping with the more difficult issues that can arise at home and school during the adolescent years. Andrew Schlegelmilch discusses common parenting challenges and offers advice drawn from his extensive experience working with teenagers with autism and their families as Head Psychologist at a college preparatory school. He offers parents professional guidance on what to do about falling grades, how to handle adolescent tantrums, how to talk about sex and sexuality with your child, how to help your child with peer relationships, how to keep your child safe online, and what to do if you suspect your child has mental health problems. Integral to the discussion is how to set realistic expectations and encourage independence in ways that work for both your child with autism and the rest of the family, as well as how to make the best use of the help professionals can offer.",

      "description": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is currently diagnosed based on a series of behavioral tests. The challenge for researchers is to try to uncover the biological basis for these typical behaviors in order to improve diagnosis and identify potential targets for treatment. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary in order to move forward. This includes analysis of the current animal models for ASD and their suitability, reviewing immunological, immunogenetic and epigenetic research, reassessing clinical diagnostic tools, and surveying radiological, pathological, and serological records for clues. This volume includes research from some of the leading researchers on ASD. We are hopeful that it will stimulate further dialogue and research in this challenging field.",

      "description": "Advocating for an increased emphasis on evidence-based practice, this book describes and analyses a wide range of available Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) assessment measures. The author offers guidance on how to evaluate services and programmes and how to recognise which will be most effective in different scenarios for people with differing needs. A wide range of measures are reviewed in detail, including assessments used in situations often ignored in overviews relevant to ASD, such as assessments of internet addiction, response to traumatic stress, and criminal offending risk and witness credibility. This book is an invaluable resource to professionals who support people with ASDs, including social workers and teachers, and who are under increasing pressure to reliably assess which services, programmes and therapies are effective and fit-for-purpose.",

      "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a relatively new diagnostic label which reflects the variability and differentiation of symptomatology among children and youth commonly described as having autistic disorder, high-functioning autism (HFA), and Asperger's syndrome. Current best practices have emerged from decades of evidence-based research, research-to-practice translation of empirically supported procedures, and consensus-driven recommendations from multiple disciplines. As a result, practitioners have many educational and intervention choices for children and youth with ASD--what is critical is that these options are informed by empirical outcomes that have been replicated in experimental trials (group and single-case) and disseminated to professionals and researchers alike. Children and Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a state-of-the-art volume of 15 chapters across four thematic sections that reflect the current convention of viewing autism along a continuum of presenting symptoms. Skillfully edited by James K. Luiselli, sections cover diagnosis, assessment, and measurement; evidence-based practices; health and development; and additional topics such as mindful caregiving and support, CBT, and behavioral family intervention. Compiling the most up-to-date advances in approaches toward diagnosis, education, treatment, and program development, Children and Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) will be a valuable resource for professionals and trainees in the ASD field including psychologists, educators, therapists, behavior analysts, and similar practitioners. It is also appropriate for academic researchers and courses devoted to clinical psychology, special education, developmental disabilities, and special topics.",

      "description": "This cutting-edge resource provides a comprehensive review of available assessment tools for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), presenting up-to-date evidence for their efficacy as well as best practice for selecting appropriate forms of assessment across the lifespan. Gathering together the latest international research evidence, Kenneth J. Aitken provides a clear evaluation of the commonly used assessment measures, and examines other tools not yet validated for ASD assessment but which are likely to have promising applications for the field. The tools covered include those relating to core assessment areas, such as cognitive ability, communication, motor skills and executive function, as well as supplementary and emerging areas of assessment, such as behaviour and attention, sensory issues, anxiety and depression, friendships and loneliness, and internet safety. This pioneering report will be an indispensable primary reference for researchers, academics, clinicians, service providers and commissioners.",

      "description": "LAST UPDATE: 28. September 2022 If you are looking for a comprehensive and pragmatic yet concise and up-to-date React.js feat. Hooks book, the Road to React is for you. What you will learn. In \"The Road to React\" you will learn about all the fundamentals of React.js with Hooks while building a full-blown React application step by step. While you create the React application, every chapter will introduce you to a new React key feature. However, there is more than only the fundamentals: The book dives into related topics (e.g. React with TypeScript, Testing, Performance Optimizations) and advanced feature implementations like client- and server-side searching. At the end of the book, you will have a fully working deployed React application. Is it up to date? Programming books are usually outdated soon after their release, but since this book is self- published, I can update it as needed whenever a new version of something related to this book gets released. I am a beginner. Is this book for me? Yes. The book starts from zero and takes you through the learning experience step by step. Every chapter builds up on the learnings from the previous chapter. In addition, at the end of every chapter, exercises fortify your lessons learned. If you got stuck in a chapter, you will always find a reference URL to the status quo of the actual code. Core Concepts Pragmatic: Master React while building a complete application step by step. Problems Solving: You need to experience a problem first before solving it.
